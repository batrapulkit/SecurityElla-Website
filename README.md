## ✨ A Note from the Founder

I started SecurityElla in **2021** because I saw a growing gap between people who **wanted to learn cybersecurity** and those who had **access to real-world, hands-on training**. This website represents not just a project — but a personal journey, a startup dream, and a small but meaningful step toward a more secure digital world.

Thank you for checking out SecurityElla. 🚀  
Let’s build a safer internet, together.
